## In summary

!!! Info "How-to guides are..."
    ... **directions** that take the reader through the steps required to solve a **specific** real-world problem. How-to guides are **goal-oriented**.

!!! Tip "A list of product features"
    The list of how-to guides helps frame the picture of what your product can actually do.

    A rich list of how-to guides is an encouraging suggestion of a product’s capabilities.

!!! Success "Solve a problem"
    Stick to the practical goal of fixing one real-world problem.

    Practical usability is more helpful than completeness.

    Don't explain concepts. It will get in the way of the action. If explanations are important, link to them.

    But be flexible to the reality of the problem a user might actually face. Prepare for the unexpected, alert user to its possibility, and provide guidance on how to deal with it.

    Ultimately, unlike in a tutorial, the user has responsibility for getting themselves in and out of trouble.

!!! Failure "How-to guides are not lessons"
    **It’s not the responsibility of a guide to teach how to make something.**

    Following a guide requires at least basic competences, and is not a substitute for a lessons about these basic competences.

    Someone expecting to follow a guide, and instead is given a lesson, will be **disappointed and annoyed**.

    Context and history might be interesting. But the one time someone does not want to be faced with it is while they are in the middle of trying to make it.

    Exclude teaching and discussions. Focus on **how to**, and directions.

!!! Failure "Tutorials vs how-to guides"
    **How-to guides are wholly distinct from tutorials.** They are easily conflated, as both describe a series of practical steps that lead to the completion of some task. The user-needs that they serve are quite different however. Do not conflate them.

    Like a tutorial, a how-to guide contains a sequence of actions, that have an order.

    Unlike a tutorial, you don't have to start at the beginning of the whole story, and take your reader to the end.

!!! Info "Pick a good title"
    **Choose titles that say exactly what a how-to guide shows.**

    - Good: *How to integrate application performance monitoring.*
    - Bad: *Integrating application performance monitoring*.
        - Maybe the document is about how to decide whether you should, not about how to do it.
    - Very bad: *Application performance monitoring*.
        - Maybe it’s about how - but maybe it’s about whether, or even just an explanation of what it is.

    Note that search engines appreciate good titles just as much as humans do.

- Most likely, your user will be in the middle of something.
    - You only need to provide a starting point that they know how to reach.
    - And a conclusion that actually answer a real question.
- How-to guide should work, but it is OK if occasionally they are broken. User should be able to extrapolate a fix.

## The language of how-to guides

`This guide shows you how to…`
:   Describe clearly the problem or task that the guide shows the user how to solve.

`If you want x, do y. To achieve w, do z.`
:   Use conditional imperatives.

`Refer to the x reference guide for a full list of options.`
:   Don’t pollute your practical how-to guide with every possible thing the user might do related to x.
