## In summary

!!! Info "Explanation are..."
    ... **discussions** that clarifies and illuminates particular topics. Explanations are **understanding-oriented**.

    They **clarifies, deepens, and broadens** the reader's understanding of a subject.

    Unlike tutorials and how-to guides that are concerned with user needs, and unlike reference material that is a close-up view of the machinery, explanations is documentation approaching **particular** topics from a **higher perspective**, and with a **different angle**.

    As discussions, they are more relaxed, and freer to consider something. **Explanations join things together.** It does not even have to be centred on the product itself.

!!! Abstract "It is open ended"
    It’s not always easy to write good explanatory material. Where does one start? It’s also not clear where to conclude. There is an open-endedness about it that can give the writer too many possibilities.

    In the case of explanation, it’s useful to have a real or imagined why question to serve as a prompt. Otherwise, you simply have to draw some lines that mark out a reasonable area and be satisfied with that.

!!! Success "Same importance, less urgent"
    Explanations, unlike the other three forms of documentation, don’t have a direct part in a user’s practice or work.

    Sometimes, it is seen as being of lesser importance. That’s a mistake; it may be **less urgent** than the other three, but it’s **no less important**.

    It’s not a luxury. No practitioner of a craft can afford to be without an understanding of that craft, and needs the explanatory material that will help weave it together. Otherwise, the practitioner's knowledge is loose, fragmented, and fragile. And their exercise is anxious.

!!! Success "Talk *about*"
    Explanation guides are about a topic in the sense that they are around it. Even the names of your explanation guides should reflect this.

    You should be able to place an implicit (or even explicit) about in front of each title. For example: About user authentication, or About database connection policies.

!!! Failure "Don't instruct"
    Explanation should do things that the other parts of the documentation do not.

    It’s not the place of an explanation to instruct the user in how to do something. Nor should it provide technical description.

- **Make connections** to other things, even to things outside the immediate topic.
- **Provide background and context**
    - Explain why things are so: design decisions, historical reasons, technical constraints, etc.
    - Draw implications.
    - Mention specific examples.
- Discuss **alternatives and (contrary) opinions**, counter-examples, or different approaches to the same question.
    - Open-up the topic for considerations.

## The language of explanation

`The reason for x is because historically, y…`
:   Explain.

`W is better than z, because…`
:   Offer judgements and even opinions where appropriate..

`An x in system y is analogous to a w in system z. However…`
:   Provide context that helps the reader.

`Some users prefer w (because z). This can be a good approach, but…`
:   Weigh up alternatives.

`An x interacts with a y as follows:…`
:   Unfold the machinery’s internal secrets, to help understand why something does what it does.
