## In summary

!!! Info "Reference are..."
    ... **technical descriptions** of the machinery and how to operate it. Reference material is **information-oriented**.

!!! Tip "The only purpose of reference material"
    It describes, as clearly and succinctly as possible, in an orderly way. It is consistent, accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive.

    It is austere, and to the point. It is consulted, not read.

    It provides truth, and certainty. It is authoritative.

    Contrary to tutorials and how-to guides which are led by user needs, reference material is led by the product it describes.

!!! Success "Not how-to, but how-does"
    Reference should not attempt to show how to perform tasks.
    However, it can, and often needs to include a description of how something works, or the correct way to use it.

    An example can provide a succinct way of illustrating something, and its context. But it should not be a tutorial, or a how-to guide.

!!! Example "Often generated, but not only"
    Generating automatically the reference material from API documentation is a good way to keep it up-to-date.

    But it does not necessarily cover all the reference that is needed.

## The language of reference materials

`X is an example of y. W needs to be initialised using z. This option does that.`
:   State facts about the machinery and its behaviour.

`Sub-commands are: a, b, c, d, e, f.`
:   List commands, options, operations, features, flags, limitations, error messages, etc.

`You must use a. You must not apply b unless c. Never d.`
:   Provide warnings where appropriate.
