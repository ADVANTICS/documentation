## In summary

!!! Info "Tutorials are..."
    ... **lessons** that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. Tutorials are **learning-oriented**.

!!! Tip "The only thing that really matters"
    The pupil should **enjoy** the experience or working with your product, and **gains confidence**, and wants to **do it again**.

!!! Success ""
    The pupil does not have to learn now. It will learn over time.

!!! Success ""
    Don't try to teach. Provide a journey, from simplest to complex.

    Have them use the tools and perform the operations they need to become familiar with.

!!! Success ""
    From the start, paint a complete picture of what a pupil can achieve.

    But remember, it's a journey. It does not matter if they don't reach their final destination.

!!! Failure ""
    - No abstraction or generalisation.
    - No explanation.
    - No choices.
    - No information.

- Help a beginner achieve **basic competence** with a product.
    - => They can go on to use the product for their own purposes.
- Show the learner that they can **be successful** with the product.
    - => Have them do something both **meaningful** and **attainable**.
- A lesson in **learning how**, instead of ~~learning what~~.
    - Ie. *practical skills*, instead of ~~*theoretical skills*~~.
- After a tutorial, the learner can **start to make sense** of the rest of the documentation, and the product itself.
- **Facts and explanations are irrelevant** to what the pupil will learn.
    - What matters is **what the pupil gets to do**.
- Tutorials eliminate the unexpected. It must work.
- There is **no responsibility** on the pupil **to learn, understand or remember**.
    - Learner only has to **follow teacher's directions**.
- The exercise(s) must be:
    - *Meaningful*: Provides a **sense of achievement**.
    - *Successful*: Be able to **complete it**.
    - *Logical*: The learning path needs to **make sense**.
    - *Usefully complete*: Must have an **encounter with** all of the actions, concept and tools they **need to become familiar with**.
- A tutorial for beginners is not a manual for best practices.
- For **confidence build-up**, ensure:
    - To maintain a **friendly tone**.
    - To keep a consistent use of language.
    - To have a **logical progression**.
    - **It works reliably, and repeatedly!**
        - Test your tutorials regularly.
    - They **see results** immediately, iteratively.
        - Effect of their actions should be clear to them ASAP.
        - Causes and effects should be evident.
        - Don't make too big chunks before it can run.
        - Each result should be meaningful.
- Describe **concrete steps**, not ~~abstract concepts~~.
    - Be specific and particular about actions and outcomes.
- Offer only **minimum, necessary, explanations**.
    -  The learner is focused on following your directions and getting a result.
    - Their time for wanting to know more about the why of what they’re doing will come later.
    - You may include links to further explanatory materials.
- Ignore ~~options and alternatives~~.
    - Your job is to guide the learner to **A** successful conclusion.

## The language of tutorials

`In this tutorial, you will…`
:   Describe what the learner will accomplish (note - not: “you will learn…”).

`First, do x. Now, do y. Now that you have done y, do z.`
:   No room for ambiguity or doubt.

`We must always do x before we do y because… (see Explanation for more details).`
:   Provide minimal explanation of actions in the most basic language possible. Link to more detailed explanation.

`The output should look something like this…`
:   Give your learner clear expectations.

`Notice that… Remember that…`
:   Give your learner plenty of clues to help confirm they are on the right track and orient themselves.

`You have built a secure, three-layer hylomorphic stasis engine…`
:   Describe (and admire, in a mild way) what your learner has accomplished (note - not: “you have learned…”)
