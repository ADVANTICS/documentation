## Megawatt Charging Systems (MCS)
The SPCC offers a built-in support for the latest Megawatt Charging System (MCS) standard. Its ability to interface with and control MCS charging stations natively allows for the swift development of Megawatt-level chargers while significantly reducing time to market.

## Fast Charging Stations
With its support for protocols like CHAdeMO, CCS, MCS, and NACS, this SECC ensures compatibility with the latest vehicle charging standards. Its capability for bidirectional power transfer (BPT) and Plug & Charge functionality (coming soon) allows for seamless user experiences, while its compatibility with OCPP 1.6 and 2.0.1 (coming soon) enables effortless control and monitoring from a centralized platform.

## SECC for Wallboxes
For wall-mounted chargers, the SPCC excels with its compact design and flexible mounting options. It can be easily installed on a DIN rail or behind an LCD display (optionally provided with it), fitting seamlessly into various setups. Its support for bidirectional standards and native compatibility with bidirectional power modules—such as the VG11—enables rapid development of compact, bidirectional DC wallboxes.

## Rugged and Versatile SECC
Built for demanding environments, the SPCC can be housed in a certified heavy-duty enclosure, making it a reliable option for harsh conditions. Its robust design ensures longevity and consistent performance, even in extreme scenarios, making it an excellent choice for outdoor charging stations as well as for exotic applications like battery powered genset and rescue vehicles.
