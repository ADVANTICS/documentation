CM_ BO_ 2147909637  "
                Sent during any powered phase of a DC charge session. This message contains the
                power function in use, setpoint targets or range, the setpoints mode, the output
                bleeding command, and the present vehicle SoC.

                # Power function

                The power function currently in use is given by <<DC_Power_Control.Power_Function>>.
                It covers the off state, standby, insulation test, precharge and the actual power
                transfer.

                During __Standby__, power modules should disable any power processing function (ie.
                turn off), but not bleed their output capacitors (ie. leave the output floating) as
                a load might be connected at that time.

                During __Insulation_Test__, the insulation of the cable is tested by applying a
                voltage from the charger. The battery is not connected yet. The test voltage to
                apply is given by <<DC_Power_Control.Target_Voltage>>. Power modules report
                <<Power_Modules_Status.Present_Voltage>> and <<Power_Modules_Status.Insulation_Resistance>>
                and the controller decides when the test passes or fails. Safety standards require a
                minimum of 100 Ohms/V insulation resistance. With a typical test voltage of 500 V,
                insulation resistance should be >= 50 kOhms. Maximum current to use is not specified.

                During __Precharge__ (CCS only), charger is expected to match battery voltage at its
                output while having no load, apart from capacitors on the line. When charging this
                capacitive load, it shall not output more current than <<DC_Power_Control.Current_Range_Max>>.
                The battery voltage to match is given by <<DC_Power_Control.Target_Voltage>>. The
                vehicle decides to consider precharge done when it senses on its inlet a voltage that
                is +/- 20 V of its battery voltage.

                During __Power_Transfer__, actual power is being transfered in one direction or
                another. The meaning of setpoints depends on <<DC_Power_Control.Setpoints_Mode>>.
                The transfer direction depends on the sign of current setpoints, with positive
                meaning power being delivered to the vehicle (ie. charge). And negative meaning
                power extracted from the vehicle (ie. discharge).

                NOTE: While targets and ranges are expressed in both voltage and current, it is up
                to power modules to determine which control mode they should use (ie. constant current,
                constant voltage or constant power) depending on the present situation, and the load
                attached to their output. Charging protocols do not define it. In a typical situation,
                insulation tests and precharge have to be controlled in Constant Voltage. Whereas,
                when a battery is connected to the charger output, the vehicle BMS specifies the
                maximum current to be delivered to it, or consummed from it. Which makes it a
                Constant Current process. But you might also encounter a vehicle with a different
                pack voltage (eg. 800 V), and using a DC/DC in between the charger output and its
                battery to convert the voltage. In such case, you might have to run into Constant
                Voltage mode for instance.

                # Setpoints mode

                Either the vehicle control the current to be delivered or consummed (that's
                __Target_Mode__). Or, a range of acceptable values is given, and power modules are
                free to operate within that range (that's __Range_Mode__).

                In the simplest (historical) case, power transfer is unidirectional, with the
                vehicle requesting a certain amount of current for a target voltage, and power
                modules have to deliver that current. __Target_Mode__ is used in that case.
                And both min and max of the range have the same value. If you do less current than
                requested, some vehicle might accept it, and some might terminate the charge on a
                current deviation error. <<Power_Transfer_Parameters.Maximum_Charge_Current>> offers
                a way to dynamically \"negotiate\" a lower current request properly.

                If the vehicle and/or charging protocol wants to use limits instead of targets (eg.
                CHAdeMO V2G, or ISO 15118-20 in Dynamic mode), then __Range_Mode__ is used. The min
                and max of the range are given, and power modules can choose the actual load and
                power transfer direction within that range.

                Note however that, if in your application power modules are not able to decide of
                the load by themselves, then you can treat the maximum of the range as the target
                setpoint (which is why the same signal is used for both target and maximum).

                During a power transfer, the setpoint mode does not change between range or target.
                However, during the rest of the session, for consistency, during __Insulation_Test__
                it will be __Target_Mode__. And during __Precharge__ it will be __Range_Mode__.
                During other power functions it is not relevant.

                # Bidirectional power transfers

                Bidirectional power transfers are only possible when both the vehicle and the charger
                supports it (on charger side, `is_bidirectional` has to be set to True in the config
                file for that pistol). Bidirectional power transfer can happen either in
                __Range_Mode__ (power modules choose when to switch over) or __Target_Mode__ (vehicle
                decides when it is time to charge or discharge its battery). Bidirectional in range
                mode would typically happen with CHAdeMO V2G, or ISO 15118-20 in Dynamic mode.
                Whereas birectional in target mode would happen with ISO 15118-20 in Scheduled mode.

                When in range mode, a portion of the range will be in the negative values (or all of
                it if only discharge is possible). Note that the positive portion of the range, used
                for charging, naturally follows min and max charge current values. Whereas the
                negative portion of the range, used for discharging, is mirrored, and its min and
                max are logically inverted. Said differently <<DC_Power_Control.Current_Range_Min>>
                shows the maximum discharge current, but with a negative sign. And
                <<DC_Power_Control.Current_Range_Max>> shows the maximum charge current with a
                positive sign.

                In the particular situation only discharge is possible, the minimum of the range is
                still the maximum discharge current with a negative sign. And the maximum of the
                range is then the minimum discharge current, also with a negative sign.

                As such, you can see this range as a \"continuous slider\" on which you can pick an
                operating point, moving between the maximum discharge current (the min), and the
                maximum charge current (the max). With 0 as a midpoint (but not necessarily
                symmetric). If no discharge is possible, then the min is positive. And if no charge
                is possible, then the max is negative.

                Controller implements a timeout on the reception of this message. It is used as a
                source of interlock condition. As such, this interlock source is evaluated only in

                Therefore, it is NOT evaluated when waiting for a PEV to plug-in, or when
                negotiating the connection with the PEV.

                Power modules should be alive from the moment <<New_Charge_Session>> is sent, until
                <<Charge_Session_Finished>> is sent. At any other time, power modules are allowed to

CM_ SG_ 2147909637 Power_Function "
                    This signal describes the sort of power function expected from power modules at
                    a particular point in the process.

                    __Off__: Power modules turn off any power processing function. And the output of
                    the charger (exposed on the pistol pins) has ~0 V, floating.

                    __Standby__: Power modules do not run any power processing function, while
                    remaining ready to receive future requests. A load might still be connected to
                    their output. Therefore, unless comanded by <<DC_Power_Control.Output_Bleed>>,
                    it should remain floating, with contactors still closed, and no discharge of
                    their output capacitors should be attempted.

                    __Insulation_Test__: Power modules (or an external dedicated safety module) apply
                    high voltage and measure the current leaked through ground. The test voltage
                    reaches up to the vehicle, but its input contactors are still open.

                    __Precharge__: Power modules match the requested voltage while limiting their
                    output current (only some capacitance should be charged during this process).
                    The purpose is to avoid arcing when vehicle contactors close.
                    Precharge is specific to CCS. In CHAdeMO you either have a diode at the output
                    of the charger (unidirectional). Or a custom precharge circuit around the main
                    output contactors (bidirectionnal, or unidirectional made without diode).

                    __Power_Transfer__: Main mode of operation, as power is being transfered in one
                    way or another. See the documentation of <<DC_Power_Control.Setpoints_Mode>> and
                    others signals of this message for more details.

                    should follow the given targets. Min and max of the range have the same value.

                    __Range_Mode__: All parties provide ranges of acceptable limits, and the
                    controller gives a merged view of that range. Power modules are then free to
                    provide or draw power within that range.

CM_ SG_ 2147909637 Output_Bleed "
                    Tells when charger output should forcibly be lowered to less than or equal to
                    20 V. It can be done by opening output contactors and/or bleed the voltage of
                    power modules output capacitors.

                    Note that how you lower the output voltage depends on when the bleed is requested
                    and for which purpose. As well as if you have output contactors or solely rely
                    on capacitor bleeding.

                    Can only happen in __Standby__ function, with voltage and current setpoints set
                    to 0.

                    Output bleed is requested at the following points in the charge session:

                    - After insulation test, and before precharge (CCS) or power transfer (CHAdeMO).
                      In this case, the controller does not command output contactors to open by
                      itself (ie. using its onboard relay) as they would have to reclose shortly
                      after. It will however wait that output voltage lower to <= 20 V to comply
                      with charging standards. Therefore, this one is more about bleeding output
                      capacitors before continuing to next step.
                    - After power transfer, when <<Advantics_Controller_Status.State>> is
                      __Ending_Charge__, current has lowered to less than 1 A, and after having
                      opened output contactors (using controller own relay). In this case, the
                      controller does not need to wait for voltage to lower. Note that at this point
                      the vehicle battery might still be connected to charger output (hence why it
                      does not wait on the voltage). Which means if your charger does not have output
                      contactors, you should actually avoid bleeding output capacitors at this point,
                      and ignore the bleed request.
                    - When entering <<Advantics_Controller_Status.State>> == __Closing_Communication__
                      if output voltage is above 20 V. It could happen after a welding detection
                      process from the vehicle in case there are no output contactors and output
                      capacitors are still charged (or got recharged during welding detection). This
                      bleed request is for safety, in order to avoid exposing high voltages on the
                      pistol contacts once it gets unplugged from the vehicle.

                    This signal is useful only for chargers using one of the supported power module
                    interface (ie. we directly control power modules), plus the generic interface
                    as a mean of external control.

                    When <<DC_Power_Control.Setpoints_Mode>> == __Range_Mode__, and power modules
                    are of a kind that cannot decide of the load current by themselves, by default
                    the maximum of the range will be used.

                    With this signal, you can set a different target setpoint that will be send to
                    power modules. Direction of power transfers is chosen with the sign of this
                    signal. When the sign changes, a switch over will happen.

                    Values are always capped to the allowed range given in <<DC_Power_Control>>.
                    Provided values will also be ramped up or down, using ramp slopes defined by

                    Note that the actual setpoint sent to power modules is not reflected in
                    <<DC_Power_Control>> message, as values in this message need to keep
                    reflecting the full allowed range. Ie. <<DC_Power_Control>> will not emulate
                    a __Target_Mode__, and it will still show the normal __Range_Mode__.

                    Note also that while the same functionality could be achieved by changing
                    <<Power_Transfer_Parameters.Maximum_Charge_Current>>, this Range_Target_Current
                    signal is actually entirely internal, and the value is never directly reported

                    maximum charge current advertised to the vehicle.

                    - <<DC_Power_Control.Setpoints_Mode>> == __Target_Mode__.
