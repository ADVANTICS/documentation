                Test the insulation of the cable by applying a voltage from the charger. The battery
                is not connected yet. Power modules report <<Power_Modules_Status.Present_Voltage>>
                and <<Power_Modules_Status.Insulation_Resistance>> and the controller decides when
                the test passes or fails.

                Safety standards require a minimum of 100 Ohms/V insulation resistance. With a
                typical test voltage of 500 V, insulation resistance should be >= 50 kOhms.

                when it senses voltage on its inlet to be close at 20 V to battery voltage.

                Charger is expected to match battery voltage at its output while having no load,
                apart from the capacitors on the line. When charging this capacitive load, it shall

                Sent during the main charging loop. The vehicle is basically requesting current.
                Note that while the request is expressed in both voltage and current, it is up to
                power modules to determine which control mode they should run (ie. constant current,
                constant voltage or constant power).

                WARNING: The vehicle might not necessarily ramps up or down its requests.

                IMPORTANT: It is also sent at few other moments in the charging process with values
                <<Charging_Loop.Target_Voltage>> == 0 and <<Charging_Loop.Target_Current>> == 0.
                This has the meaning of telling the power modules to go into a sort of \"Standby\"
                mode. The power modules should turn off any power processing function, while remaning

                ====
                Controller implements a timeout on the reception of this message. It is used as a
                source of interlock condition. As such, this interlock source is evaluated only in
                states where power modules should be alive.

                Therefore, it is NOT evaluated when waiting for a PEV to plug-in, or when
                negotiating the connection with the PEV.

                Power modules should be alive from the moment <<New_Charge_Session>> is sent, until
                <<Charge_Session_Finished>> is sent. At any other time, power modules are allowed to
                sleep and not send this message.
