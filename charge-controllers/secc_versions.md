# Charge Station Controller Versions

## Hardware

Currently supported hardware are for `ADM-CS-SECC` (using Vertexcom PLC chipset and Toradex Colibri iMX7 SoM).

Past hardware variants (no longer supported) were based firstly on the versatile `ADM-CO-CUI1` unit,
then on the first version of the `ADM-CO-EVCC` unit, both being "Gen2" variants (ie. using Qualcomm
PLC chipset and Toradex Colibri iMX6 SoM).

## Software

### Major releases

Major releases are result of months of development, consolidation, extensive testing and user feedbacks.
They are slow paced because the release process is substantial.
