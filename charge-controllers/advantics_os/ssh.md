# SSH Access

> [!NOTE]
> SSH is not the preferred method to access the device in controllers running AdvOS. Please use the [ CSM Web UI ](charge-controllers/advantics_os/csm-web-ui.md) instead unless SSH is strictly necessary.

Grab the hostname of the controller as documented in [Accessing and interacting with the controller](charge-controllers/advantics_os/connecting.md).

Example:

`ssh advantics@adm-cs-<controller-type>-<serial-number>.local` ie. `ssh advantics@adm-cs-spcc-12345678.local`

The root login is disabled and the default user is `advantics`. The default password is `dev-only`.

Please change the default password as soon as you log in. Remember that if you need to run privileged commands, you can use `sudo`.

<div class="noheader-table small-table compact-table">

| \*           | \*          |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| **Login**    | _advantics_ |
| **Password** | _dev-only_  |

For controllers meant for series production, the following hardening methods are available.

- Strong, randomized password initialized at first boot of the system after installation.
- SSH key provisioned on the system, and SSH password login restricted.

> [!ATTENTION]
> For series production, you will have to choose at least one of these methods. ADVANTICS will
> refuse to provide series production orders with system having simple, always the same, default
> password. Even if you don't plan to have the module connected to Internet.
