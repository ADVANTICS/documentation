# SSH Access

> [!NOTE]
> SSH is not the preferred method to access the device in controllers running AdvOS. Please use the [ CSM Web UI ](charge-controllers/advantics_os/csm-web-ui.md) instead unless SSH is strictly necessary.

Grab the hostname of the controller as documented in [Accessing and interacting with the controller](charge-controllers/advantics_os/connecting.md).

Example:

`ssh advantics@adm-cs-<controller-type>-<serial-number>.local` ie. `ssh advantics@adm-cs-spcc-12345678.local`

The root login is disabled and the default user is `advantics`. The default password is `dev-only`.

Please change the default password as soon as you log in. Remember that if you need to run privileged commands, you can use `sudo`.

<div class="noheader-table small-table compact-table">

| \*           | \*          |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| **Login**    | _advantics_ |
| **Password** | _dev-only_  |

</div>

For controllers meant for series production, the following hardening methods are available.

- Strong, randomized password initialized at first boot of the system after installation.
- SSH key provisioned on the system, and SSH password login restricted.

> [!ATTENTION]
> For series production, you will have to choose at least one of these methods. ADVANTICS will
> refuse to provide series production orders with system having simple, always the same, default
> password. Even if you don't plan to have the module connected to Internet.


# Copying files to the controller using SCP
Using the Command Line (Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL/PowerShell).

- Open a terminal (or Command Prompt / PowerShell on Windows if you have scp available).

- Navigate to the folder where your file is located. For example: `cd /path/to/your/file`

- Run the scp command to copy the file:

     ```bash
    scp <filename> <username>@<hostname>:<destination-path>
    ```

    Replace:

    `<filename>` â€“ with the name of the file you want to copy

    `<username>` â€“ with the login user on the remote device **(use `advantics`)**

    `<hostname>` â€“ Grab the hostname of the controller as documented in [Accessing and interacting with the controller](charge-controllers/advantics_os/connecting.md).

    `<destination-path>` â€“ with the target directory on the device **(use `/home/advantics`)**

    Example: `scp myupdate.tar advantics@adm-cs-spcc-12345678:/home/advantics`

- Enter the password for the device when prompted. (the default is _dev-only_)

# Full release update

## Loading the update

### Option 1 (requires internet): Pulling the update from Docker Hub

In case the controller is connected to the internet, you can easily load the new images using the command: 
```bash
/etc/advantics/compose.sh default pull
```
Please note that here we're using the default profile (`default`), more steps might be needed if you're using a different profile or have modified the default one.

***Then jump to [Common steps](#common-steps)***

### Option 2 (does not requires internet): Loading the images from a .tar file

This is for updating one or several of the application containers. Advantics provide you a _.tar_
file. The process is to:

1. Copy the update file to the controller following the guide here: [Copying files to the controller using SCP](#copying-files-to-the-controller-using-scp)

2. [Login to the controller](#ssh-access)

3. Load the new images from the .tar file using this command:
```bash
docker load -i /path/to/update.tar
```
(Replace `/path/to/update.tar` by the actual path and name of the .tar file)

### Common steps
- After updating the applications, use the following command to recreate and start new containers:
```bash
/etc/advantics/compose.sh default up -d
```
Please note that here we're using the default profile (`default`), more steps might be needed if you're using a different profile or have modified the default one.

- Then, to clean up and delete the old images, you can use:
```bash
docker image prune
```
