## Form factor

All the ADVANTICS power modules from the MCP-25 series share a similar mechanical and electrical form factor. For example every module fits on a 300 mm wide heatsink, the height is chosen such that a space from the module base to the top of the module is always maximum 70 mm – allowing the customer to reuse the same cooling and housing concept for every MCP-25 series power converter.
Some of the common features are:
    - The narrowest X-Y dimension is less than 300 mm
    - The height of the module is less than 70 mm
    - The power inputs and outputs use M5 threaded screw terminals
    - The communication interface uses 8-pin JST CPT connector
    - Each power module have at least one (optimally two) communication interface connectors
    - All mounting screws holes for mounting to the heatsink are designed for 5 mm screws
    - 24V powered
