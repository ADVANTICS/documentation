                Sent during the main charging loop. The vehicle is basically requesting current.
                Note that while the request is expressed in both voltage and current, it is up to
                power modules to determine which control mode they should run (ie. constant current,
                constant voltage or constant power).

                WARNING: The vehicle might not necessarily ramps up or down its requests.

                IMPORTANT: It is also sent at few other moments in the charging process with values
                <<Charging_Loop.Target_Voltage>> == 0 and <<Charging_Loop.Target_Current>> == 0.
                This has the meaning of telling the power modules to go into a sort of "Standby"
                mode. The power modules should turn off any power processing function, while remaning
                ready to receive future requests.

                ====
                Controller implements a timeout on the reception of this message. It is used as a
                source of interlock condition. As such, this interlock source is evaluated only in
                states where power modules should be alive.

                Therefore, it is NOT evaluated when waiting for a PEV to plug-in, or when
                negotiating the connection with the PEV.

                Power modules should be alive from the moment <<New_Charge_Session>> is sent, until
                <<Charge_Session_Finished>> is sent. At any other time, power modules are allowed to
                sleep and not send this message.

                This message has most flags controlling the charge sequence (apart from System_Enable).

                The first byte is for flags having effect before a charge session starts.
                The second byte is for flags having effect during parameters negotiation.
                The third byte is for flags having effect during power stages (insulation test,
                precharge and charging).

                The controller config file should have the entry "use_sequence_flags = true" in the
                "[charger]" section in order to take them into account.

                To make sure the controller is taking a first message as initialisation of these
                flags, send this first message after Advantics_Controller_Status message reports a
                State of Waiting_For_PEV (value 1).

                All signals default to value 0. Bits that are not used in this version should remain
                at 0 to avoid incompatibility with future versions.
