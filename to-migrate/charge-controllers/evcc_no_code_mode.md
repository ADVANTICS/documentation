# No code mode

This is not a particular mode _per se_. But rather a combination of three optional features of
Advantics controller that makes it possible to reach demonstrative working DC charge very quickly
without developing anything. It uses:

* DC contactors drivers embedded in the controller directly (see [DC contactors](charge-controllers/evcc_configuration/dc_contactors.md) config)
* A supported CAN sensor, that Advantics can directly provide you (see [CAN sensor](charge-controllers/evcc_configuration/can_sensor.md) config)
* [No BMS mode](charge-controllers/evcc_configuration/no_bms.md)

With these three features, you don't have to provide any data over CAN bus to the controller, and
you won't have to control any component yourself.

> [!ATTENTION]
> The same disclaimers than in [No BMS mode](charge-controllers/evcc_configuration/no_bms.md) section apply. Use this only for quick
> demonstration, under a controlled environment, with low, safe and reasonable voltage and current
> values.
