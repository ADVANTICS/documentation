# Charger Controller supported insulation monitors

## Bender isoCHA425HV

Our charge controller offers out-of-the-box support for the Bender isoCHA425HV insulation monitoring device via RS485 communication. This seamless integration reduces development time and accelerates time to production for customers, ensuring reliable insulation monitoring and enhanced system safety.

The Bender isoCHA425HV integration is intended for use exclusively with DC charging pistols, such as CCS and CHAdeMO.

You can check how to enable this feature in [configuration section](charge-controllers/secc_configuration).
