# Safety Hazards

>[!ATTENTION] This safety mark informs the user about this equipment that BEFORE any usage of this equipment the user MUST READ all the safety instructions contained in this operating manual. The most important general safety precautions are summarized below in this preface.

>[!ATTENTION] Death, serious injury, or fire hazard could result from improper connection of this instrument. Read and understand this manual before connecting this instrument. Follow all installation and operating instructions while using this instrument.

>[!ATTENTION] The instrument may only be operated by personnel who are capable of recognizing contact hazards and implementing appropriate safety precautions. Contact hazards are present anywhere where voltages of greater than 50 V exist. This is very important when the open-ended output signal cable is used or any OEM/PCB version of equipment is operated, tested or else used.

>[!ATTENTION] Do not work alone by performing measurements which involve contact hazards. In such cases some other person must always be present.

>[!ATTENTION] Do not use the equipment when the attached battery/another module or output signal cable discharge by sparks or it appears to short circuit (due high-voltage sparks or failure of the battery/module/cable).

>[!ATTENTION] The equipment usage under damp ambient conditions is prohibited.

>[!ATTENTION] The device leads (power & data cable) must be kept in flawless conditions, e.g. no damage to insulation, no interruptions at cables and plugs etc.

>[!ATTENTION] If it may be assumed that the instrument can no longer be safely operated, it must be removed from the
service or the factory/laboratory and secured against unintentional use.
Safe operation can be no longer assumed:
(1) If the module, power cables or any cables show visible damage,
(2) If the module no longer functions,
(3) If the module shows very dirty conditions because of dust etc.
(4) After lengthy periods of storage under unfavorable conditions,
(5) After exposure to unusual transport stresses.

>[!ATTENTION]As long as the module is connected, conducting parts may be exposed to the voltage. Maintenance and repair work, as well as internal device balancing (if applicable), may be performed only by trained personnel who are familiar with the dangers involved.
In as far as is reasonably possible, the instrument must be disconnected from all external power sources before the performance of this type of work. A waiting period of 2 minutes must be observed after the module has been disconnected in order to allow for the discharging of internal capacitors to a safe voltage level.
