# ADVANTICS MCP-25 power converter family

MCP-25 is a series of high efficiency power converters based on the SiC (Silicon Carbide) technology. By combining modules, it is possible to implement a wide variety of power conversion systems, including bidirectional grid connectivity, EV charging and battery storage - up to 500kW.

Modules of the MCP-25 family are:
- ADM-PC-BP25 active front-end
- ADM-PC-LL25 unidirectional isolated DC/DC
- ADM-PC-LF45 3-phase filter and precharge
- ADM-PC-UP25 power factor correction
- ADM-PC-BC25 unidirectional buck
- ADM-PC-BI25 bidirectional isolated DC/DC
