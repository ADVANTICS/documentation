  "hardwareDescription": [
    "This 3-phase filter and precharge module is prepared to allow connecting an active front end to the utility grid. It contains the needed EMC filters and the precharge and main connection relays needed for utility grid connection (400VAC or 480VAC).",
    " Its integrated DSP control performs all the needed tasks to ensure that the downstream equipment is properly precharged and protected before the mains relay is closed, and therefore, the customer needs minimal effort to integrate it."
