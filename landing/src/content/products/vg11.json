  "hardwareDescription": [
    "The VG11 power module is a highly versatile bidirectional 11kW AC/DC converter designed for a wide range of applications, offering a **bidirectional power flow** for seamless energy transfer. With an **output voltage range of 0 to 920V** and **current range of 0 to 30A**, the VG11 is capable of delivering high power while maintaining a **peak efficiency of over 96%**, making it ideal for energy-efficient systems.",
    "Its **input voltage range of 100-240VAC** and ability to handle up to **48A input current** provide flexibility for different power grids, while its broad **AC mains frequency range of 45-65 Hz** ensures compatibility across regions. The VG11 is built with robust **protection features**, including overcurrent, overvoltage, overtemperature, and hardware interlock, ensuring safe and reliable operation in demanding environments.",
    "The VG11 power module is an ideal solution for **bidirectional wallboxes.** With its wide **voltage range (0-920V)** covering all the CCS range, it natively supports both **400V and 800V EVs**. Its **bidirectional power flow** makes it ideal for **Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)** applications, providing reliable, efficient energy transfer for modern EVs."
