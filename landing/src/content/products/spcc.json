    "### **Fast Charging Stations**",
    "The SPCC (Single Pistol Charge Controller) is designed to handle both **AC and DC fast charging**, making it an excellent fit for high-demand charging stations. With its support for protocols like **CHAdeMO, CCS, MCS, and NACS,** this SECC ensures compatibility with the latest vehicle charging standards. Its capability for **bidirectional power transfer (BPT)** and **Plug & Charge** functionality (coming soon) allows for seamless user experiences, while its compatibility with **OCPP 1.6 and 2.0.1** enables effortless control and monitoring from a centralized platform.",
    "### **MegaWatt Charging Systems (MCS) Capable SECC**",
    "The SPCC is fully prepared for the future of high-power charging, offering built-in support for the latest **MegaWatt Charging System (MCS)** standard. Its ability to interface with and control power modules natively in different combinations allows for the swift development of M**egaWatt-level chargers** while significantly **reducing time to market**.",
    "### **SECC for Wallboxes**",
    "For wall-mounted chargers, the SPCC excels with its **compact design** and **flexible mounting** options. It can be easily installed on a **DIN rail** or **behind an LCD display** (optionally provided with it), fitting seamlessly into various setups. Its support for **bidirectional standards** and **native compatibility** with bidirectional power modules—such as the **VG11**—enables rapid development of compact, **bidirectional DC wallboxes**. ",
    "### **Rugged and Versatile SECC**",
    "Built for demanding environments, the SPCC can be housed in a **certified heavy-duty enclosure**, making it a reliable option for **harsh conditions**. Its robust design ensures longevity and consistent performance, even in extreme scenarios, making it an excellent choice for **outdoor charging stations** as well as for exotic applications like **battery powered genset and rescue vehicles**."
