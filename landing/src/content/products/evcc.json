    "Our EVCC (EV Charge Controller) integrates all essential I/O and software stacks required for AC and DC charging protocols. The system features comprehensive handling of CP (Control Pilot) and PP (Proximity Pilot) signals, a built-in PLC modem, and compliance with key industry standards:",
    "- **IEC 61851-1, -23**: Including AC over Base Signaling (PWM).\n- **ISO 15118-3 (SLAC)** and **DIN SPEC 70121**: Enabling efficient DC charging.\n- **ISO 15118-2 and 15118-20**: Supporting DC, and bidirectional charging (BPT) with Plug and Charge (PnC) capabilities.",
    "The controller includes a **CAN bus** interface, offering seamless integration into your system or with various off the shelf Battery Management Systems (BMS), including the Orion BMS.  It also supports common commercial sensors like **Isabellenhutte** **IVT-S** and **Sendyne**.",
    "Key features include:",
    "- **Lock and Contactor Control** (optional), ensuring secure charging sessions.\n- **Thermal Management** with progressive derating and emergency stop features.\n- **No Code Mode** for quick and easy setup.\n- **Industrial-grade GPIO**, providing configurable functions for flexible control.\n- **Wake-up and Sleep Modes**, activated by CP state changes or general-purpose outputs.\n- **Firmware Updates** via PLC on the CP line or Ethernet, with **SSH access** for advanced configuration, logs, and updates.\nThis charge controller is engineered for demanding applications today and future-proofed for tomorrow, making it an ideal solution for and modern EV."
