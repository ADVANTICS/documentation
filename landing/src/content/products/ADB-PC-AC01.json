  "hardwareDescription": [
    "The new ADVANTICS ADB Series is a system of stackable power modules for DC Fast Charge stations supporting CCS, NACS, and MCS charging standards, as well as various energy storage system applications and industrial power systems. Its no-compromises design is fully sealed and liquid cooled to ensure the highest levels of reliability in any operating environment. From corrosive coastal regions, to the humid tropics, to scorching hot deserts, to the frigid arctic, it can handle them all.",
    "In order to streamline product development, the 100kW AC/DC frontend contains integrated features such as AC mains management and grid code integration. It features an extremely wide output voltage/current range, reactive power control, common DC link bus for distributed DC-coupled systems.",
    "The integrated gateway allows for easy firmware update, isolated CAN bus interface, parallel stack management and cybersecurity.",
    "As a vertically integrated company, we don’t rely on 3rd party black boxes and are therefore able to give our customers full control of their system.",
    "All of ADVANTICS products are proudly designed and manufactured in the European Union. 🇪🇺"
