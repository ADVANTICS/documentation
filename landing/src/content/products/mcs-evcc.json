  "hardwareDescription": [
    "Fully prepared for the future of high-power charging, offering built-in support for the latest **MegaWatt Charging System (MCS)** standard. Optimized for heavy-duty and marine applications, the MCS EVCC enables **rapid charging** for large electric vehicles and vessels. With its robust design and advanced features, it facilitates energy transfer at **megawatt levels**, significantly **reducing charging times** for commercial and industrial electric vehicles. ",
    "The controller includes a **CAN bus** interface, offering seamless integration into your system or with various off the shelf Battery Management Systems (BMS), including the Orion BMS. It also supports common commercial sensors like **Isabellenhutte** **IVT-S** and **Sendyne**.",
    "Key features include:",
    "- **MCS charging** according to **IEC 61851-23-3 and ISO 15118-20.**\n- **Bidirectional Power Transfer (BPT)** capability.\n- **Heavy-duty certified** enclosure.\n- **Lock and Contactor Control** (optional), ensuring secure charging sessions.\n- **Thermal Management** with progressive derating and emergency stop features.\n- **Industrial-grade GPIO**, providing configurable functions for flexible control.\n- **Wake-up and Sleep Modes**, activated by CE state changes or general-purpose outputs.\n- Support of user-written applications\n- **No Code Mode** for quick and easy protyping."
