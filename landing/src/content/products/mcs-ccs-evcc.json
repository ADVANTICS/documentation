  "hardwareDescription": [
    "Fully prepared for the future of high-power charging, offering built-in support for **MCS** and **CCS** standards. Optimized for heavy-duty and marine applications, this EVCC enables **rapid charging** for large electric vehicles and vessels. With its robust design and advanced features, it facilitates energy transfer at **megawatt levels**, significantly **reducing charging times** for commercial and industrial electric vehicles. ",
    "The controller includes a **CAN bus** interface, offering seamless integration into your system. It also supports common commercial sensors like **Isabellenhutte** **IVT-S** and **Sendyne**.",
    "Key features include:",
    "- **MCS charging** according to **IEC 61851-23-3 and ISO 15118-20.**\n- **CCS charging** capability.\n- **Bidirectional Power Transfer (BPT)** capability.\n- **Heavy-duty certified** enclosure.\n- **Lock and Contactor Control** (optional), ensuring secure charging sessions.\n- **Thermal Management** with progressive derating and emergency stop features.\n- **Industrial-grade GPIO**, providing configurable functions for flexible control.\n- **Wake-up and Sleep Modes**, activated by CE and CP state changes or general-purpose outputs.\n- **No Code Mode** for quick and easy protyping."
