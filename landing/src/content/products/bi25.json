  "hardwareDescription": [
    "ADM-PC-BI25 (or known as BI25) is an advanced DC/DC power converter that provides reinforced galvanic isolation between its two ports without the need for a large mains frequency transformer. The converter is fully bidirectional and isolated able to operate at up to 50 kW power and 1000 V with 98% peak efficiency.",

    "The thermal system of this converter is specially built to allow BI25 to rely entirely on conductive heat transfer, enabling the system to be installed in a sealed enclosure. The integrated control system features overvoltage, overcurrent and overtemperature protection systems to enhance operational safety. The unit is controlled via an industry standard CAN v2.0B bus. All its control signals are published via KCD/DBC files allowing easy integration into a supervisory control system.",

    "In combination with our [**bidirectional power converter ADM-PC-BP25**](https://advantics.fr/products/bp25/), the BI25 can be built in parallel in DC/DC mode to achieve power delivery at megawatt scales.",

    "Thanks to its compact, robust and a simplified design system, BI25 can operate in extreme environments including high altitudes up to 3000 metres — helping you implement the Megawatt Charging System (MCS) wherever you need.",

    "Looking to deploy MCS charging stations or simply charge a battery from the grid? We’ve got you covered.",

    "**<span class='text-accent'>ADVANTICS power converters exemplify European innovation, addressing global energy needs in demanding applications such as megawatt charging. Fully designed and developed in-house, these Made in EU converters use advanced silicon carbide technology. Our engineering team is located in France and manufacturing facilities in the Czech Republic.</span>**"
