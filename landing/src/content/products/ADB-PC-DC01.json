  "hardwareDescription": [
    "The new ADVANTICS ADB Series is a system of stackable power modules for DC Fast Charge stations supporting CCS, NACS, and MCS charging standards, as well as various energy storage system applications and industrial power systems. Its no-compromises design is fully sealed and liquid cooled to ensure the highest levels of reliability in any operating environment. From corrosive coastal regions, to the humid tropics, to scorching hot deserts, to the frigid arctic, it can handle them all.",
    "The ADM-PC-DC01 is the first product on the market specifically designed to be MCS (Megawatt Charging System) compliant. Supporting the full 200V-1500V output voltage range (R-MCS), and paralleling up to 6MW.",
    "The integrated gateway allows for easy firmware update, isolated CAN bus interface, parallel stack management and cybersecurity.",
    "As a vertically integrated company, we don’t rely on 3rd party black boxes and are therefore able to give our customers full control of their system.",
    "All of ADVANTICS products are proudly designed and manufactured in the European Union.  🇪🇺"
